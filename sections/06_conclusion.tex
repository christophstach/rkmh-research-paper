\section{Conclusion}

In this work the author explained the functionality of MinHashing. The technique originally came from the field of text mining and is now used in various applications of bio informatics \cite{rkmh, mash, sourmash}.\\

The focus lied on the rkmh toolkit, wich uses MinHashing for classification of infections and co-infections of various viruses.\\

It is clear to say that MinHashing is well suited for comparison and similarity estimation of large sets of DNA sequences. Therefor it is an interesting topic in the field of bio informatics.\\
