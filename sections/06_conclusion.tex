\section{Conclusion}

In this work, the author explained the functionality of MinHashing. The technique originally came from the field of text mining and is now used in various applications of bio informatics \cite{rkmh, mash, sourmash}.\\

The focus lied on the rkmh toolkit. It uses MinHashing for classification of infections and co-infections of various viruses.\\

There is enough evidence to suggest that MinHashing is well suited for comparison and similarity estimation of large sets of DNA sequences. Therefore it is an interesting topic in the field of bio informatics.\\
