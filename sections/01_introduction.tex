\section{Introduction}

This work is about the rkmh toolkit, developed by \citeauthor{rkmh} \cite{rkmh}. In order to better understand where the rkmh toolkit is coming from, it is useful to understand the fundamentals of it first. The field of bio informatics often deals wich large numbers of DNA sequences, generated with next sequencing technology tools. Sequences are also existent in the field of text mining, where literature often talks of documents. The author explains the methods used in text mining and draws a connection to the field of bio informatics to give a better understanding how the two fields relate to each other. An explanation of the rkmh's remaining features is given in the section afterwards. Finally, the author gives examples of alternative use cases and states his personal view in the subject matter in the conclusion.
