The rkmh toolkit is a collection of algorithms and filtering methods recently released. It is used for the classification of reads of DNA sequencing technologies. The authors of the algorithm state, that it is especially useful and more for finding co-infections of different but similar sublineages of viruses. They demonstrate their results for the Human papillomavirus (HPV) by presenting different statistics of their algorithm. Rkmh is based on a technique called MinHashing, which used in the field of text mining. This work aims to supplement the original paper of the rkmh toolkit by drawing a connection between the field of text mining and bio informatics. Also the author compares it to other algorithm and gives a brief perspective about alternative use cases.
