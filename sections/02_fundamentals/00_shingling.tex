\subsection{Shingling}

The first step of comparing two documents is generate the shingles $ S_k $ of each document. Given two documents $ A = "abccdab" $ and $ B = "bccdacb" $. The documents are  converted into a sets of shingles with the size of $ k $. For $ k = 3 $ the resulting sets are: \\

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        S_3(A) = \{abc, bcc, ccd, cda, dab\} \\
        S_3(B) = \{bcc, ccd, cda, dac, acb\} \\
        S_3(A) \cup S_3(B) = \{abc, bcc, ccd, cda, dab, dac, acb\}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}\\

In text mining, literature often talks about the generation of k-shingles or k-grams of documents. In bio informatics, the same idea applies to the generation of k-mers of DNA sequences.\\

Shingling documents makes them better comparable. Comparison is done in the text step.\\
