\subsection{Jaccard coefficient}

The Jaccard coefficient is a metric used to measure the similarity of two sets.\\

\begin{equation}
    J(A,B) = \frac{ | A \cap B | }{ | A \cup B | }
\end{equation}\\

It is calculated by counting the intersection of $ A $ and $ B $ and dividing it by its union. The result is a rational number between $ 0 $ and $ 1 $, where numbers close to $ 1 $ mean that the compared sets are similar. Having two sets which are completely equal generates a jaccard coefficient of $ 1 $.\\
