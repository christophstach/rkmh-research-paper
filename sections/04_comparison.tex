\section{Comparison with other algorithms}


BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) \cite{blast} finds regions of similarity between biological sequences. It was developed in 1990 and databases of biological sequences were much smaller in this time period. Today new sequencing technologies produce much more data. Today, researches are striving to develop new tools to handle this increase.\\

Mash \cite{mash} uses MinHashing to reduce large biological sequences to small sketches. By comparing sketches pairwise, mutation distances between sequences can be estimated. This enables clustering and searching a huge sequences sets.\\

Rkmh builds up on the on mash \cite{mash}. It uses MinHashing and extends Mash by adding different filters.\\

Sourmash \cite{sourmash} also uses MinHashing. It is designed to facilitate containment and similarity queries for taxonomic exploration within large datasets.\\
